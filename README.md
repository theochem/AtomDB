# AtomDB

## About

AtomDB is a versatile, free, and open-source Python library for accessing and managing atomic and
promolecular properties. It serves as an extended database or periodic table of neutral and charged
atomic properties, offering accurate experimental and computational data for various atomic
charge/multiplicity states. AtomDB is a [QC-Devs](https://qcdevs.org/) project.

## Documentation

AtomDB's documentation, including installation and usage instructions, as well as API documentation, is available at [atomdb.qcdevs.org](https://atomdb.qcdevs.org/).

### Functionality

- **Atomic scalar properties**

  AtomDB provides a wide range of atomic properties for neutral and charged atoms, including: **Atomic number**, **Atomic symbol**, **Atomic mass**, **Atomic radius**, **van der Waals radius**, **Covalent radius**, **Ionization potential**, **Electron affinity**, **Electronegativity**, **Atomic polarizability**.

- **Point dependent properties**

  AtomDB provides functions to calculate point-dependent properties, such as:
  **Electron density** $\rho(r)$,
  **Electron density gradient** $\nabla \rho(r)$,
  **Electron density Laplacian** $\nabla^2 \rho(r)$,
  **Electron density Hessian** $\nabla^2 \rho(r)$ (for these properties, only the radial part is provided),
  and **Kinetic energy density** $ked(r)$.

  The computation of contributions per orbital, set of orbitals, or spin to these properties is also supported.

- **Promolecular properties**

  AtomDB provides the capabilities to create promolecular models, and then estimate molecular properties from the atomic properties.

- **Dumping and loading**

  AtomDB provides the capability to dump and load atomic properties to and from JSON files.

For a complete list of available properties, see [this
table](https://atomdb.qcdevs.org/api/index.html#properties).

## Installation

We recommend using Python 3.9 or later. The `qc-grid` is need to run `AtomDB`. You can install it
from source for now:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:theochem/grid.git
cd qc-grid
pip install .
```

Then,
`qc-AtomDB` can be installed using `pip`:

```bash
pip install qc-AtomDB

```
